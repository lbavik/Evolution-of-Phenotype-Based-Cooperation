# Evolution-of-Phenotype-Based-Cooperation
This code simulates how strategies for cooperation based on phenotypical similarity evolve in a population.

In the May 22 update, the user specifies the following parameters: population, generations, number of phenotype dimensions, selection strength, strategy mutation parameter, phenotype mutation parameter, initial population's strategy, burn in time, cost and benefit of the prisoner's dilemma matrix, and finally the loose and strict threshold values for the loose/strict players.

The program outputs four files: (1) the statistics (mean, variance, etc) of the various phenotypes, (2) the radial distances of every individual of the population, (3) a list of all the phenotypes of every member of the population, (4) the parent map of the strategy mutations present at any given time.
